Method List :

1) checkForCycle
2) DetectFaultyNode


Above two are too steps for Floyd's cycle detecting algorithm.
It is also known as tortoise and hare algorithm.

It helps to find out following :
	1)Whether cycle exist or not
	2)What is the faulty node
	3)Distance of faulty node from startig
	4)Length of the loop

Questions:
	1)How to detect if there exists multiple faulty nodes ?
	2)How to optimize algorithm for large linkedlist ?
