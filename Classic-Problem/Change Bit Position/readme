1. Soluion for this problem should be approached in bottom up manner.
2. I need to changes N.
3. Find the number with whom I should be doing "and", "or" operation of N.
4. How will I achieve that number using M, i and j.

5. Another observation. We wnat to change least no of bits. So "and" operation will lead to quick solution 
	compared to "or" operation.
