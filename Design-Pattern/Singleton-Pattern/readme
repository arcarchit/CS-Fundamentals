1. Suppose you want to create only one object of a class

These happens mostly for Utility classes.
Example, 
A class that string to upper case. (Assume java String don't provide this functionality)
Or you want to validate xml recieved from web, whether it is currpt or not.

2. Steps to make a class SingleTon :
Make constructor private
Static method that return object of this class (This object is staic)

If you want to do lazy initializtion don't create the object in advance.

When this static method is invoked check whether object is null or not.
If it is null create and return the object else return the object.
