1. Interface Animal
	sound
2. Animal can be Cat, Dog or Lion
3. Factory.getInstance(“Cat”);
4. We are actually hiding object creation from client. Let client just supply String. It does not need to call constructor.

Although we have taken Animal as interface, same pattern can be applied to Superclass also.
